	This is the result of the data pipeline of match statistics 
	from my current favorite game [Company of  Heroes 3](https://community.companyofheroes.com/coh-franchise-home/company-of-heroes-3).


	It turns out the enthusiasts behind [coh3stats](https://coh3stats.com/stats/games) already did the best dashboards I could imagine. 
	However, I thought that there could always be more queries to be run to explore data from some other angle. 
	And while coh3stats guys do store and [expose raw data](https://coh3stats.com/other/open-data), 
	I got the impression that the format is not very data analyst friendly.
			
	Check out the [readme](https://github.com/pavlokurochka/data-engineering-zoomcamp2024-project2/blob/main/README.md) for the GitHub repository. Data is hosted and updated using only free tier resources. This pipeline runs daily on GitHub Actions and stores data in [MotherDuck](https://app.motherduck.com/).
	This app retreives the pivot of match size data with DuckDB to display results in the table and the graph below.
